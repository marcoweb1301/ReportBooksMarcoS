      <p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Title:</b> The Innocence of Father Brown</p><br>
      <p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Author:</b> G.K Chesterton (Fiction)</p><br>
      <p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Number of pages:</b> 207</p><br>
      <p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Difficulty:</b> 1</p><br>
      <p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Type of Book:</b> Novel</p><br>
      <p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Setting of place:</b> London</p><br>
      <p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Setting of atmosphere:</b> Nerve-wracking</p><br>
      <p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Why i choose this book ?:</b> I choose this book because i like detective stories. Detective stories make me think chronologically which i like to do. Then, in detective stories, usually the author show many philosophical principles which i like too. With philosophical principles, i was invited to think deeply about life that sometimes many people forget. The title is also interesting for me. Usually, detective stories have a title that sounds fierce and mysterious. But, this book is different. The title seems to only describe an innocent person instead of smart and cunning person. Then, usually other detective stories approach this with physical evidence and logic. But, Father Brown (main character of this book) is a humble catholic priest that uses his deep understanding of human nature to expose criminal act. Apart from that, Father Brown is also someone who seems inconspicuous but has extraordinary intelligence. G.K. Chesterton's writing style is also a special attraction. He presents stories with language rich in metaphor and irony. The stories in this book also have various interesting settings, ranging from small villages to big cities, which add variety to Father Brown's adventures. The book also offers a different perspective on evil and good, and how someone can make mistakes without realizing it. This makes The Innocence of Father Brown not just an ordinary detective book, but also a reflection on life and humanity.  Each case solved by Father Brown not only presents a criminal puzzle, but also contains reflections on sin, repentance, and justice. Last but not least, The Innocence of Father Brown is also interesting because it presents a mystery in a short story format. This allows readers to enjoy a variety of diverse stories without having to follow one long storyline, making it more flexible to read at any time.</p><br>
      <p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Characters:</b><br>
      1. Father Brown<br>
      A Catholic priest who appears simple and unassuming, but has extraordinary intelligence in understanding human psychology. Unlike other detectives who rely on physical evidence and scientific deduction, Father Brown solves cases with a deep understanding of human nature and morality. His experience as a priest who often hears confessions makes him able to recognize the mindset of criminals.<br><br>
      2. Flambeau<br>
      A former intelligent criminal who later repented and became Father Brown's best friend and partner in several cases. As a former criminal, Flambeau has extensive knowledge of the criminal world, which often helps Father Brown in solving cases.<br><br>
      3. Hercule Flambeau<br>
      This character often appears in various Father Brown stories, initially as a master criminal who deceives many people. However, after several meetings with Father Brown, he finally repents and becomes a private detective. <br><br>
      4. Inspector Valentin<br>
      A French police detective who once hunted Flambeau before eventually working with Father Brown on several cases. <br><br>

      <b>Plot:</b><br>
      1. The Blue Cross<br>
      This story introduces Father Brown and Flambeau. Flambeau, who was still a criminal at the time, planned to steal a valuable cross from Father Brown. However, Father Brown, with his cleverness, managed to turn the tables and capture Flambeau.<br><br>
      2. The Secret Garden<br>
      A murder mystery in a closed park baffles the police. However, with his understanding of human nature, Father Brown finds that the culprit is someone who was not suspected at first. <br><br>
      3. The invisible man<br>
      In this story, a man is seemingly murdered by "someone invisible." However, Father Brown realizes that the killer is not literally invisible, but rather someone who is often overlooked by those around him. <br><br>
      4. The Hammer of God<br>
      An arrogant man known as a sinner was found dead with his head smashed by a heavy object. At first, everyone thought that this was divine punishment. However, Father Brown investigated further and found that the killer had a personal motive. <br><br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>My general opinion:</b> One of the main strengths of this book is the simple yet intelligent character of Father Brown. As a priest, he has a broad insight into human nature, which helps him recognize the hidden motives behind a crime. He not only finds out how a crime happened, but also why someone did it, which gives psychological depth to the story. In addition, G.K. Chesterton's writing style is very interesting. He uses language rich in irony, humor, and philosophy, making the story not only entertaining but also thought-provoking. Each short story in this book has a unique plot with an ending that is often unexpected, providing its own satisfaction for readers who like mystery puzzles. Overall, The Innocence of Father Brown is a book that will appeal to both detective story lovers and readers looking for deeper meaning in a crime story. With unique characters and a plot full of surprises, this book remains relevant and inspiring today. One of the interesting aspects of this book is how Chesterton portrays crime as something that is born from human weakness and error, not just as an act that can be explained by logic alone. This makes his stories more profound than the average detective story, because the reader is invited to see crime not only as an illegal act, but also as a moral dilemma. Although the case solving in this book may seem boring to some readers (it is not as dramatic as other detective stories), I think the simplicity and wisdom of Father Brown make this book so unique and memorable.</p><br>
      <p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>What did you like best about the book?:</b> What I like most about The Innocence of Father Brown is how G.K. Chesterton builds the character of Father Brown as a unique detective that is different from other detective characters. Usually, detectives in crime stories rely on sharp logic, forensic analysis, or scientific deduction methods. However, Father Brown uses a more humanistic approach—he understands crime not only from physical evidence, but from the perspective of psychology and morality. 

        Another uniqueness that I like is how Father Brown is often underestimated because of his simple appearance. However, it is precisely in his simplicity that extraordinary intelligence and wisdom are hidden. He is able to reveal the truth not with sophisticated technology or complicated investigations, but with a deep understanding of human nature. 
        
        In addition, Chesterton's writing style is also the main attraction. He uses language full of irony and subtle humor, making these stories more than just ordinary mystery stories. Each story has a surprising ending, but still makes sense and often contains a deep moral message. 
        
        Overall, I like how this book is not only entertaining, but also thought-provoking. The Innocence of Father Brown is not just about solving the case, but also about understanding humans and the reasons behind their actions. The physical depiction of each character is so good that when reading, we can imagine and feel the stature of each character.
      
        Also, I love how the book remains relevant today. Although written over a century ago, the moral conflicts and dilemmas raised in the stories are still applicable to modern life. The evil in the story is not only physical, but also involves lies, greed, and moral confusion that we often encounter in real life.</p> <br>
        <p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>What did i like least ?:</b> One of my least favorite things about The Innocence of Father Brown is that some of the stories in the book can feel a little too short and rushed in their resolutions. Because it is a collection of short stories, some of the interesting mysteries are sometimes resolved quickly without much character development or further exploration. For readers who are used to longer, more complex detective novels, this can feel a bit unsatisfying. 

          Additionally, G.K. Chesterton’s writing style, while witty and humorous, can sometimes feel heavy-handed and convoluted. He often uses complex metaphors and wordplay that require a lot of attention to understand. For some readers, especially those new to his work, this can make the story a little difficult to follow. 
          
          The character of Father Brown himself, while interesting, can sometimes seem a little too perfect in his understanding of criminal psychology. Unlike other detectives who struggle or make mistakes in their investigations, Father Brown almost always knows the answer from the start and just has to explain it to the other characters. This can make some of the stories feel less suspenseful, as there is no real challenge for the protagonist. Beside of that, Some of the stories feel like they dont give the reader much space to guess who the perpetrator is. In many classic detective stories, the reader is usually invited to collect clues and try to solve the mystery before the answer is revealed. However, in this book, Father Brown often knows the truth right from the start based on his understanding of human psychology, without many clues for the reader to follow. This makes some of the stories feel more like philosophical lectures than solvable puzzles.</p><br>
          <p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>What is my favorite quotation?:</b> "wisdom must take into account the unexpected."</p><br>
          <p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>Would i recommend this reading to my friend ?:</b> Yes, i will recommend this book to my friends. Unlike classic detectives like Sherlock Holmes who rely on deductive logic or Hercule Poirot who focuses on logical psychology, Father Brown solves cases with an understanding of morality and human nature. This method provides a new perspective in the world of detective stories that makes this book interesting and different from the others. Not just a mystery story, The Innocence of Father Brown also invites readers to understand more deeply about human nature, sin, and justice. This book contains many moral reflections that can enrich the reader's thinking. Then, Each story in this book has an unexpected ending, which keeps the reader curious and want to read more. Beside of that, Father Brown often finds solutions in unusual ways, making each story have its own surprises. Then, G.K. Chesterton writes in a style full of humor, irony, and clever wordplay. This makes this book not only interesting in terms of story, but also enjoyable to read in terms of language and delivery. The characterization in this book is also natural. Father Brown is not a detective who is stylish or has extraordinary skills, but rather a simple man who uses his wisdom and understanding of humans to solve mysteries. His character feels closer to real life than other detectives who are often depicted as almost perfect. Some detective novels require readers to understand complicated deduction methods or forensic investigation techniques. In this book, the mystery is more based on psychology and simple logic, so it can be enjoyed by anyone without having much knowledge of the detective world.</p><br>
